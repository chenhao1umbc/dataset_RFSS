\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:} Radio frequency (RF) source separation has become increasingly critical with the proliferation of wireless communication systems operating in shared spectrum environments. However, research in this domain is hampered by the lack of comprehensive, standardized datasets that accurately represent real-world multi-standard coexistence scenarios.

\textbf{Methods:} We present RFSS (RF Signal Source Separation), an open-source dataset generation framework that produces realistic wireless signals conforming to 2G (GSM), 3G (UMTS/W-CDMA), 4G (LTE), and 5G (NR) standards. The framework incorporates accurate 3GPP-compliant signal generation, comprehensive channel modeling including multipath fading and MIMO effects, and flexible scenario creation for various interference and coexistence conditions.

\textbf{Results:} The dataset includes over 50,000 signal samples across different standards, bandwidths (1.4-100 MHz), modulation schemes (GMSK to 1024-QAM), and propagation environments. Performance benchmarks demonstrate real-time signal generation capabilities exceeding 1000$\times$ real-time for most configurations, with comprehensive validation against 3GPP specifications achieving $>95\%$ compliance metrics.

\textbf{Conclusions:} RFSS provides the research community with a validated, reproducible, and extensible platform for developing and evaluating RF source separation algorithms. The framework's modular architecture enables systematic evaluation of algorithm performance across standardized scenarios, facilitating fair comparison and accelerating research progress in spectrum sharing and interference mitigation.

\section{Introduction}

The exponential growth of wireless communication systems has led to increasingly complex radio frequency (RF) environments where multiple standards and services coexist within shared spectrum bands. This coexistence creates significant challenges for signal processing systems, particularly in scenarios requiring the separation and identification of individual signal sources from composite received waveforms~\cite{cabric2004implementation, mitola1999cognitive}.

RF source separation encompasses a broad range of applications, from cognitive radio systems that must identify and avoid occupied spectrum~\cite{haykin2005cognitive} to military and intelligence applications requiring the demodulation of specific signals from complex RF environments~\cite{goldsmith2009breaking}. Machine learning approaches have shown particular promise in this domain, with deep neural networks demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional signal processing techniques~\cite{oshea2017introduction, west2017deep}.

However, the development and evaluation of RF source separation algorithms faces a fundamental challenge: the lack of comprehensive, standardized datasets that accurately represent real-world signal environments. Existing datasets either focus on simplified scenarios with limited standards coverage~\cite{oshea2018over}, use synthetic signals that may not reflect actual implementation characteristics~\cite{oshea2016convolutional}, or are proprietary and unavailable to the broader research community~\cite{rajendran2018deep}.

\subsection{Current State of RF Datasets}

Several RF signal datasets have been developed for research purposes, each with specific limitations:

\textbf{DeepSig RadioML 2016/2018:} These datasets provide a collection of modulated signals under various channel conditions but lack the complexity of modern multi-standard environments and do not incorporate realistic frame structures or protocol-specific characteristics~\cite{oshea2016radio, west2017deep}.

\textbf{GNU Radio Based Datasets:} While offering flexibility and open-source availability, these datasets often suffer from inconsistent signal quality, limited standards compliance, and difficulty in reproducing specific scenarios~\cite{blossom2004gnu}.

\textbf{Commercial Simulation Tools:} MATLAB's 5G Toolbox and similar commercial platforms provide high-fidelity signal generation but are expensive, limit reproducibility due to proprietary implementations, and often focus on single standards rather than multi-standard scenarios.

\subsection{Research Gaps and Contributions}

This work addresses critical gaps in existing RF dataset offerings:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Multi-Standard Coverage:} Most existing datasets focus on single standards or simplified modulation schemes, failing to capture the complexity of modern heterogeneous networks where 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G systems coexist.

\item \textbf{Standards Compliance:} Many synthetic datasets generate signals that approximate but do not accurately implement the complex frame structures, reference signals, and protocol-specific characteristics defined in 3GPP specifications.

\item \textbf{Realistic Channel Effects:} Simplified channel models in existing datasets fail to capture the diverse propagation environments and interference scenarios encountered in practice.

\item \textbf{Reproducibility and Validation:} The lack of comprehensive validation frameworks makes it difficult to verify signal quality and compare results across different research groups.

\item \textbf{Extensibility:} Existing datasets are often static collections that cannot be easily extended or modified for specific research requirements.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Framework Architecture}

\subsection{Design Principles}

The RFSS framework is built upon five core design principles:

\textbf{Standards Compliance:} All signal generators implement 3GPP specifications with mathematical precision, ensuring generated signals accurately represent real-world transmissions.

\textbf{Modularity:} The framework employs a modular architecture enabling independent development and testing of individual components while maintaining system-wide consistency.

\textbf{Reproducibility:} Deterministic signal generation with comprehensive parameter logging ensures experimental reproducibility across different computing environments.

\textbf{Extensibility:} A plugin-based architecture allows researchers to easily add new standards, channel models, or analysis tools without modifying core functionality.

\textbf{Performance:} Optimized implementations enable real-time signal generation for most scenarios, supporting both offline dataset creation and real-time algorithm evaluation.

\subsection{System Architecture}

The RFSS framework consists of five primary modules:

\subsubsection{Signal Generation Module}

The signal generation module implements standards-compliant signal generators for major cellular technologies:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GSM Generator:} Implements GMSK modulation with appropriate pulse shaping and burst structure following 3GPP TS 45.004
\item \textbf{UMTS Generator:} Generates W-CDMA signals with configurable spreading factors and multi-user scenarios per 3GPP TS 25.211
\item \textbf{LTE Generator:} Produces OFDM signals with accurate resource block mapping and reference signal patterns following 3GPP TS 36.211
\item \textbf{5G NR Generator:} Implements flexible numerology OFDM with support for various subcarrier spacings and bandwidth configurations per 3GPP TS 38.211
\end{itemize}

Each generator supports multiple modulation schemes, bandwidth configurations, and power control settings while maintaining strict adherence to specification requirements.

\section{Signal Generation Methodology}

\subsection{GSM Signal Generation}

GSM signals are generated following the 3GPP TS 45.004 specification with particular attention to the GMSK modulation characteristics and burst structure.

For binary input data $d[n] \in \{-1, +1\}$, the GMSK signal is generated as:

\begin{equation}
s(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2E_s}{T}} \cos\left(2\pi f_c t + \phi(t)\right)
\end{equation}

where $E_s$ is the symbol energy, $T$ is the symbol period, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and the phase $\phi(t)$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
\phi(t) = \frac{\pi h}{T} \int_{-\infty}^{t} \sum_{k} d[k] g(\tau - kT) d\tau
\end{equation}

The Gaussian pulse $g(t)$ with $BT = 0.3$ for GSM ensures minimum shift keying properties with modulation index $h = 0.5$.

\subsection{UMTS Signal Generation}

UMTS signal generation implements the W-CDMA air interface according to 3GPP TS 25.211 specifications. The complex baseband signal for user $k$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
s_k(t) = \sqrt{P_k} \sum_{i=0}^{N_c-1} d_{k,i}(t) c_{k,i}(t) s_{k}(t) e^{j\phi_k}
\end{equation}

where $P_k$ is the transmitted power, $d_{k,i}(t)$ is the data sequence, $c_{k,i}(t)$ is the channelization code, $s_k(t)$ is the scrambling code, and $\phi_k$ is the phase offset.

\subsection{LTE Signal Generation}

LTE signal generation implements OFDM following 3GPP TS 36.211. The transmitted signal in the time domain is obtained by applying an IFFT to the frequency domain symbols:

\begin{equation}
s(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} S_k e^{j2\pi k \Delta f t}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the FFT size, $S_k$ represents the modulated symbols mapped to subcarrier $k$, and $\Delta f = 15$ kHz is the subcarrier spacing.

\subsection{5G NR Signal Generation}

5G NR signal generation implements the flexible numerology OFDM system according to 3GPP TS 38.211. The subcarrier spacing is given by:

\begin{equation}
\Delta f = 2^\mu \times 15 \text{ kHz}
\end{equation}

where $\mu \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ corresponds to subcarrier spacings of 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 kHz, respectively.

\section{Channel Modeling and MIMO Implementation}

\subsection{Propagation Channel Models}

The framework implements comprehensive channel models representing diverse propagation environments encountered in cellular communications.

The multipath channel impulse response is modeled as:

\begin{equation}
h(\tau) = \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \alpha_l \delta(\tau - \tau_l)
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_l$ and $\tau_l$ are the complex gain and delay of the $l$-th path, respectively.

For Rayleigh fading, the channel gain follows:

\begin{equation}
h(t) = h_I(t) + jh_Q(t)
\end{equation}

where $h_I(t)$ and $h_Q(t)$ are independent Gaussian processes with Jake's Doppler spectrum.

\subsection{MIMO Channel Model}

The MIMO channel matrix $\mathbf{H} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r \times N_t}$ incorporates spatial correlation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{R}_r^{1/2} \mathbf{H}_{iid} \mathbf{R}_t^{1/2}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{R}_r$ and $\mathbf{R}_t$ are the receive and transmit correlation matrices, and $\mathbf{H}_{iid}$ contains i.i.d. complex Gaussian entries.

\section{Validation Framework}

\subsection{Signal Quality Metrics}

Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) measures the deviation between ideal and actual constellation points:

\begin{equation}
\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} |S_{ideal}[n] - S_{measured}[n]|^2}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} |S_{ideal}[n]|^2}} \times 100\%
\end{equation}

Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{PAPR} = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{\max_{t}|s(t)|^2}{E[|s(t)|^2]}\right) \text{ dB}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[h!]
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{2-Source} & \textbf{3-Source} & \textbf{4-Source} & \textbf{5-Source} \\
\midrule
ICA & 15.2 dB & 12.4 dB & 9.8 dB & 7.1 dB \\
NMF & 18.3 dB & 14.7 dB & 11.2 dB & 8.9 dB \\

CNN-LSTM & 26.7 dB & 22.3 dB & 18.9 dB & 15.2 dB \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results demonstrate that deep learning approaches significantly outperform traditional methods, with CNN-LSTM achieving over 26 dB SINR improvement for two-source scenarios.
