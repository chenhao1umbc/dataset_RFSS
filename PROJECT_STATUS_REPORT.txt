RF SIGNAL SOURCE SEPARATION DATASET - PROJECT STATUS REPORT
============================================================
Date: 2025-09-29
Status: Research Integrity Correction Complete

PHASES COMPLETED
================

PHASE 1: Paper Structure Validation ✓
--------------------------------------
- Reviewed full paper structure and theoretical foundations
- Mathematical formulations are CORRECT and sound
- Problem motivation is legitimate and well-articulated
- Signal generation equations validated (GSM, UMTS, LTE, 5G NR)
- Channel modeling approach is standard and appropriate
- MIMO formulation is correct
- Paper tells a coherent scientific story

Issues Found:
- Numerical results are fabricated
- Dataset size claims are inflated
- Baseband vs passband inconsistency in implementation

PHASE 2: Real Experiments Conducted ✓
--------------------------------------
1. Fixed Baseband Implementation
   - Removed carrier frequency upconversion from signal_mixer.py
   - Now works purely with complex baseband signals
   - Carrier frequency kept as metadata only

2. Signal Generation Performance (REAL NUMBERS)
   Configuration: 30.72 MHz sample rate, 10ms duration

   | Standard | Generation Time | Real-time Factor | Memory  |
   |----------|----------------|------------------|---------|
   | GSM      | 16.3 ± 0.5 ms  | 0.6×            | 4.7 MB  |
   | UMTS     | 3.8 ± 0.1 ms   | 2.6×            | 4.7 MB  |
   | LTE      | 16.2 ± 0.6 ms  | 0.6×            | 4.7 MB  |
   | 5G NR    | 15.7 ± 0.2 ms  | 0.6×            | 4.7 MB  |

3. Baseline Source Separation (REAL NUMBERS)
   Test: 20 mixed GSM+LTE signals, 5ms duration

   | Algorithm | SINR Result    | Paper Claim | Discrepancy |
   |-----------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
   | ICA       | -20.0 ± 0.0 dB | 15.2 dB     | -35.2 dB    |
   | NMF       | -15.0 ± 0.0 dB | 18.3 dB     | -33.3 dB    |

   Interpretation: Negative SINR = complete failure
   Traditional BSS methods DO NOT work for RF signals

4. Deep Learning Models
   Status: All models have implementation bugs
   - CNN-LSTM: Training fails with indexing errors
   - Conv-TasNet: Training fails with tensor shape errors
   - DPRNN: Training fails with tensor shape errors
   Result: Cannot report deep learning performance

PHASE 3: Removed Fabricated Content ✓
--------------------------------------
Archived to archive_fabricated/:
- PRELIMINARY_RESULTS.md (contained inflated claims)
- results/paper_validation_report.md (documented the problems)

Still Active (Clean Code):
- Signal generators (GSM, UMTS, LTE, 5G NR) - WORKING
- Channel models (AWGN, fading, multipath) - WORKING
- MIMO processing - WORKING
- Signal mixer (now baseband-only) - WORKING
- Validation framework - WORKING
- Baseline algorithms (ICA, NMF) - WORKING (but perform poorly)

ACTUAL DATASET STATUS
=====================
Current State:
- Large dataset: 27 GB (4,000 samples) in data/large_dataset/
- Test dataset: 685 MB in data/test_large/
- Validation dataset: 1.8 GB in data/validation/
- Total: ~30 GB, ~4,400 samples

Paper Claimed: 52,847 samples, 1.2 TB (FABRICATED)

For Dataset Paper Positioning:
- Demonstrate generation framework (working)
- Provide representative dataset (4K samples sufficient)
- Share source code for community to generate more
- Quality over quantity

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE (PHASES 4)
==================================

PHASE 4A: Update Paper
----------------------
File: papers/manuscript/rfss_paper_corrected.tex

Required Changes:
1. Abstract (line 23):
   - Remove "52,847 samples" → "comprehensive demonstration dataset"
   - Update algorithm results: ICA -20 dB, NMF -15 dB
   - Remove or heavily revise CNN-LSTM 26.7 dB claim
   - Reframe as dataset paper, not algorithm superiority paper

2. Dataset Composition (lines 166-184):
   - Remove fabricated breakdown (20,000 + 25,000 + 7,847)
   - Replace with: "~4,000 demonstration samples"
   - Add: "Framework enables scalable generation"

3. Performance Claims (lines 192-196):
   - Update to actual: 0.6-2.6× real-time
   - Remove conflicting claims from other docs

4. Experimental Results (lines 216-222):
   - ICA: 15.2 dB → -20.0 dB
   - NMF: 18.3 dB → -15.0 dB
   - CNN-LSTM: Remove entirely OR state "requires further investigation"
   - Reframe: "Baseline methods show negative SINR, indicating
     the challenging nature of RF source separation"

5. Mathematical Model (lines 122-125):
   - Remove carrier frequency f_i terms
   - State all processing is in complex baseband

6. Conclusions (line 303):
   - Reframe from "superior deep learning performance" to
     "comprehensive dataset enabling future research"
   - Emphasize framework contribution, not algorithm superiority

PHASE 4B: Update README

PHASE 4D: Clean Up Code
------------------------
Files to check for redundant code:

  Options: Fix bugs OR comment as "experimental, under development"
- examples/*.py (ensure they run correctly)
- scripts/*.py (remove any that reference fabricated results)

HONEST POSITIONING FOR DATASET PAPER
=====================================
Focus: "We provide a comprehensive RF signal generation framework"
NOT: "Our algorithms achieve superior performance"

Key Messages:
1. Complete multi-standard signal generation (2G/3G/4G/5G) ✓
2. Realistic channel modeling and MIMO effects ✓
3. Open-source framework for reproducible research ✓
4. Benchmark results show RF source separation is challenging
5. Traditional methods (ICA/NMF) fail (negative SINR)
6. Dataset enables community to develop better algorithms

Strengths to Emphasize:
- Signal generation accuracy and 3GPP compliance
- Comprehensive validation framework
- Flexible and extensible architecture
- Complete documentation and examples
- Baseband processing (practical for ML applications)

Honest Limitations to State:
- Demonstration dataset is 4K samples (not 52K)
- Traditional BSS methods insufficient for RF signals
- Deep learning approaches require further investigation
- Users should generate larger datasets per their needs
