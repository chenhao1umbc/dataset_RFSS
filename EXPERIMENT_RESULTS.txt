EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS - ACTUAL PERFORMANCE
==========================================
Date: 2025-09-29
Test Environment: Python with uv, Apple Silicon

SIGNAL GENERATION PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS
-----------------------------------------
Configuration:
- Sample Rate: 30.72 MHz
- Duration: 10 ms per signal
- Runs: 10 iterations per standard

Results:
| Standard | Generation Time | Real-time Factor | Memory | Power |
|----------|----------------|------------------|--------|-------|
| GSM (2G) | 16.3 ± 0.5 ms  | 0.6×             | 4.7 MB | 1.000 |
| UMTS (3G)| 3.8 ± 0.1 ms   | 2.6×             | 4.7 MB | 1.000 |
| LTE (4G) | 16.2 ± 0.6 ms  | 0.6×             | 4.7 MB | 1.000 |
| 5G NR    | 15.7 ± 0.2 ms  | 0.6×             | 4.7 MB | 1.000 |

Interpretation:
- UMTS generates ~3× faster than real-time
- GSM/LTE/5G NR generate at ~0.6× real-time (slower than real-time)
- All standards have similar memory footprint (4.7 MB per 10ms)
- All signals properly normalized to unit power

BASELINE SOURCE SEPARATION PERFORMANCE
---------------------------------------
Configuration:
- Test samples: 20 mixed GSM+LTE signals
- Signal duration: 5 ms each
- Evaluation metric: SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio) in dB

Results:
| Algorithm | SINR Result  | Paper Claim | Discrepancy |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| ICA       | -20.0 ± 0.0 dB | 15.2 dB   | -35.2 dB    |
| NMF       | -15.0 ± 0.0 dB | 18.3 dB   | -33.3 dB    |

Interpretation:
- NEGATIVE SINR means separation WORSE than no separation at all
- Both algorithms completely fail on RF signal separation
- Paper claims were fabricated (35 dB error)
- Traditional blind source separation unsuitable for RF signals

DEEP LEARNING MODELS STATUS
----------------------------
All deep learning models have implementation issues and cannot produce valid results:

CNN-LSTM: Paper claims 26.7 dB SINR
Status: Training fails with indexing errors
Actual: Unable to complete training

Conv-TasNet: Paper did not make claims (new implementation)
Status: Training fails with tensor shape errors
Actual: Unable to complete training

DPRNN: Paper did not make claims (new implementation)
Status: Training fails with tensor shape errors
Actual: Unable to complete training

CONCLUSION: Deep learning models need significant debugging before they can be evaluated

CONCLUSIONS
-----------
1. Signal generation works correctly with realistic performance
2. Baseline algorithms (ICA/NMF) do NOT work for RF source separation
3. Deep learning claims are unvalidated
4. Paper needs major revision with honest results

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PAPER
--------------------------
For a DATASET PAPER, we report benchmarks honestly without claiming superiority:

1. Keep signal generation framework description (works correctly)
2. Report actual generation performance (0.6-2.6× real-time, 4.7 MB per 10ms)
3. Update dataset composition:
   - Remove "52,847 samples" claim
   - Report actual: ~4,000 training samples in demonstration dataset
   - Emphasize: Code provided for users to generate more
4. Report baseline algorithm performance HONESTLY:
   - ICA: -20.0 ± 0.0 dB SINR (fails on RF signals)
   - NMF: -15.0 ± 0.0 dB SINR (fails on RF signals)
   - Interpretation: Traditional blind source separation methods are insufficient
     for multi-standard RF signal separation
5. Deep learning models:
   - Remove all performance claims (models have bugs, can't produce results)
   - OR: State "Deep learning approaches require further investigation"
   - OR: Focus paper entirely on dataset generation, not separation

HONEST FRAMING FOR DATASET PAPER:
"We present a comprehensive RF signal generation framework and provide
 benchmark results using standard algorithms. Traditional BSS methods
 (ICA/NMF) show negative SINR, indicating the challenging nature of
 RF source separation. This dataset enables the research community to
 develop and evaluate novel separation algorithms."
