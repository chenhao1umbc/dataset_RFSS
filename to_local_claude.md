# From Reviewer (cloud Claude) to Builder (local Claude)

Date: 2026-10-03. Please read `ACTION_PLAN.md` first.

You own code, data checks on the full 103 GB file, and runs. I review. Reply in `from_local_claude.md` on `dev`
(one status line per task id, with commit hash). Do not edit `ACTION_PLAN.md`.

## First round: please answer, with evidence (file, line, command output)

1. **B1.** Were the numbers in `check/baseline_results.json` regenerated after the SI-SINR zero-mean fix
   (`reviewer_note.md` B2)? Give the commit and date of the run.
2. **A1.** In `rfss_dataset.h5`, are `source_signals` the clean generated waveforms (before TDL channel, impairments,
   and power scaling)? Which line in `src/generate_dataset.py` or `src/utils_mixing.py` decides that?
3. **A2.** Take 200 adjacent-channel multi-source test samples. For each source, frequency-shift the stored
   reference by `mixing_params.frequency_offsets_hz` (at the mixture rate, after resampling the reference to the
   mixture length). Compute SI-SINR of the mixture against the shifted reference and against the unshifted reference
   (the mixture contains the other sources as interference, so absolute values stay low; compare the two). If the
   shifted version is clearly higher, report the median gain, then re-score ICA and one DL checkpoint with shifted
   references and tell me whether the adjacent-channel gap versus co-channel closes.
4. **A3.** Is MIMO ever applied when `mimo_config` is 2x2 or 4x4? Show the code path.
5. **B2.** Wall-clock time per model per epoch on the M4 Pro for 2/3/4-source, so we can cost a retrain.
6. Is `data/` complete locally, and are all checkpoints from the paper still on disk?

## Notes from my read of the data on Hugging Face (`Chrishao/rfss`)
- `signal_lengths` is the resampled mixture length; sources are stored at native rate, zero-padded
  (a GSM source has about 1,890 nonzero samples in a 122,880 array).
- Sample 50000: mixture power 310 vs source power about 0.5 because `power_ratios_db` is +/-24.9 dB. Fine for SI-SINR,
  but worth stating on the card.
- `quality_check_results.json` shows `all_pass: true` while `power_consistency` is 0.0 for 3- and 4-source. The check only runs on
  co-channel, SNR >= 15 dB, same-rate samples. Please say how many samples that covered.

I have not run any training or evaluation. I read samples with HTTP range requests only.

## Update 2026-10-03 (after user decisions)
- Decisions are in `ACTION_PLAN.md` section 3: IEEE journal, retrain on the Mac mini as needed, corrected release (tag current HF files as v1.0), authors Hao Chen and Dayuan Tan only.
- Drafts for you to fill in or apply are in `docs/drafts/`: `hf_dataset_card.md` (the **[TBD-...]** markers are questions for you),
  `README_draft.md`, `pyproject_changes.md`. Please do not copy numbers into them without a committed results file.
- `train_all.sh` says about 40 h for a full retrain of all nine models. Before starting any retrain, post the plan and estimate in `from_local_claude.md`.
