# A Comprehensive Multi-Standard RF Signal Dataset for Source Separation Research

## Abstract

**Background:** Radio frequency (RF) source separation has become increasingly critical with the proliferation of wireless communication systems operating in shared spectrum environments. However, research in this domain is hampered by the lack of comprehensive, standardized datasets that accurately represent real-world multi-standard coexistence scenarios.

**Methods:** We present RFSS (RF Signal Source Separation), an open-source dataset generation framework that produces realistic wireless signals conforming to 2G (GSM), 3G (UMTS/W-CDMA), 4G (LTE), and 5G (NR) standards. The framework incorporates accurate 3GPP-compliant signal generation, comprehensive channel modeling including multipath fading and MIMO effects, and flexible scenario creation for various interference and coexistence conditions.

**Results:** The dataset includes over 50,000 signal samples across different standards, bandwidths (1.4-100 MHz), modulation schemes (GMSK to 1024-QAM), and propagation environments. Performance benchmarks demonstrate real-time signal generation capabilities exceeding 1000× real-time for most configurations, with comprehensive validation against 3GPP specifications achieving >95% compliance metrics.

**Conclusions:** RFSS provides the research community with a validated, reproducible, and extensible platform for developing and evaluating RF source separation algorithms. The framework's modular architecture enables systematic evaluation of algorithm performance across standardized scenarios, facilitating fair comparison and accelerating research progress in spectrum sharing and interference mitigation.

## 1. Introduction

The exponential growth of wireless communication systems has led to increasingly complex radio frequency (RF) environments where multiple standards and services coexist within shared spectrum bands. This coexistence creates significant challenges for signal processing systems, particularly in scenarios requiring the separation and identification of individual signal sources from composite received waveforms [1, 2].

RF source separation encompasses a broad range of applications, from cognitive radio systems that must identify and avoid occupied spectrum [3] to military and intelligence applications requiring the demodulation of specific signals from complex RF environments [4]. Machine learning approaches have shown particular promise in this domain, with deep neural networks demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional signal processing techniques [5, 6].

However, the development and evaluation of RF source separation algorithms faces a fundamental challenge: the lack of comprehensive, standardized datasets that accurately represent real-world signal environments. Existing datasets either focus on simplified scenarios with limited standards coverage [7], use synthetic signals that may not reflect actual implementation characteristics [8], or are proprietary and unavailable to the broader research community [9].

### 1.1 Current State of RF Datasets

Several RF signal datasets have been developed for research purposes, each with specific limitations:

**DeepSig RadioML 2016/2018:** These datasets provide a collection of modulated signals under various channel conditions but lack the complexity of modern multi-standard environments and do not incorporate realistic frame structures or protocol-specific characteristics [10, 11].

**GNU Radio Based Datasets:** While offering flexibility and open-source availability, these datasets often suffer from inconsistent signal quality, limited standards compliance, and difficulty in reproducing specific scenarios [12].

**Commercial Simulation Tools:** MATLAB's 5G Toolbox and similar commercial platforms provide high-fidelity signal generation but are expensive, limit reproducibility due to proprietary implementations, and often focus on single standards rather than multi-standard scenarios [13].

### 1.2 Research Gaps and Contributions

This work addresses critical gaps in existing RF dataset offerings:

1. **Multi-Standard Coverage:** Most existing datasets focus on single standards or simplified modulation schemes, failing to capture the complexity of modern heterogeneous networks where 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G systems coexist.

2. **Standards Compliance:** Many synthetic datasets generate signals that approximate but do not accurately implement the complex frame structures, reference signals, and protocol-specific characteristics defined in 3GPP specifications.

3. **Realistic Channel Effects:** Simplified channel models in existing datasets fail to capture the diverse propagation environments and interference scenarios encountered in practice.

4. **Reproducibility and Validation:** The lack of comprehensive validation frameworks makes it difficult to verify signal quality and compare results across different research groups.

5. **Extensibility:** Existing datasets are often static collections that cannot be easily extended or modified for specific research requirements.

### 1.3 Paper Organization

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the RFSS framework architecture and design principles. Section 3 details the signal generation methodologies for each wireless standard. Section 4 presents the channel modeling and MIMO implementation. Section 5 describes the validation framework and quality metrics. Section 6 provides comprehensive benchmarking results and comparisons with existing datasets. Section 7 demonstrates practical applications and use cases. Finally, Section 8 concludes with discussion of limitations and future work.
